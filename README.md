# Yokai
Contributers: Vivian, Quan, Lilian, Ben

We created a survival horror game named _Yokai_.
The problem we aim to solve is boredom! By creating a fun horror game, this will _scare_ the boredom out of our players!

All assets were drawn by one of our teammates.

# Mechanics
Walking around will deplete the dehydration bar, but going near the water will replenish your dehydration. 
Swinging around the stick will deplete the hunger bar. 

Left-Click:
