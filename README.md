# Yokai
Contributers: Vivian, Quan, Lilian, Ben

We created a survival horror game named _Yokai_.
The problem we aim to solve is boredom! By creating a fun horror game, this will _scare_ the boredom out of our players!

All assets were drawn by Vivian.

# Mechanics
Walking around will deplete the dehydration bar, but going near the water will replenish your dehydration. 
Swinging around the stick will deplete the hunger bar. 

Left-Click: 
> Swings aimlessly at the Yokai

WASD: 
> Moves the Girl

e:
> Access your inventory



# Development
1. pygame and pycharm for the framework - pre-built functions made process easier to implement
2. ibisPaint and Gimp to develop assets - drew assets instead of using tiles and pixel art which made it easier to work with
3. Discord - for easy file transfer
